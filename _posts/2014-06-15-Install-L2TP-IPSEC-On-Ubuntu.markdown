I have a [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=99aaa797e467227583c245023b31dbaf9d195227) VPS with 2TB monthly  bandwidth limitation for daily Linux and other usage. This Guide will walk you through the process of installing a L2TP VPN Server on Ubuntu Server 14.04.

1. Install `xl2tpd`, `openswan` and `ppp`:

```bash
sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install xl2tpd openswan ppp
```

2. First, we need to set the firewall and make the kernel forward the ip packet:

```bash
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.0.0/16 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```
`eth0` is the network interface with public ip.
`172.16.0.0/16` is the ip range vpn client connected.

Second, we will disable `accept_redirects` and `send_redirects` to disable the kernel ICP redirects:

```bash
    for each in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*
        do
            echo 0 > $each/accept_redirects
            echo 0 > $each/send_redirects
        done
```

Finally, we will enable the ip packet forwarding and disable the kernel ICP redirects for boot by adding the following lines at the end of `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```bash
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1
```

Note: We can create a customized init script to do the 1st and 2nd steps automatically with the following steps:
1). Create a customized service script `/etc/init.d/ipsec.vpn`(You can use any file name here):

```bash
# Customized startup script for l2tp & ipsec
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          ipsec.vpn
# Required-Start:    $network $remote_fs $syslog $named
# Required-Stop:     $syslog $remote_fs
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: Start Openswan IPsec at boot time
# Description:       Customized start script to start ipsec and xl2tpd
### END INIT INFO

case "$1" in
    start)
    echo "Starting my Ipsec VPN"
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.0.0/16 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    for each in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*
        do
            echo 0 > $each/accept_redirects
            echo 0 > $each/send_redirects
        done
    /etc/init.d/ipsec start
    /etc/init.d/xl2tpd start
    ;;

    stop)
    echo "Stopping my Ipsec VPN"
    iptables --table nat --flush
    /etc/init.d/ipsec stop
    /etc/init.d/xl2tpd stop
    ;;
    restart)
    echo "Restarting my Ipsec VPN"
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.0.0/16 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    for each in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*
        do
            echo 0 > $each/accept_redirects
            echo 0 > $each/send_redirects
        done
    /etc/init.d/ipsec restart
    /etc/init.d/xl2tpd restart    
    ;;

    *)
    echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/ipsec.vpn  {start|stop|restart}"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

This script will update the firewall settings when you startup the `ipsec` service. You need add executive permission to this file:

```bash
sudo chmod 755 ipsec.vpn
```

2). And then replace the default ipsec init script with this customized script:

```bash
update-rc.d -f ipsec remove
update-rc.d ipsec.vpn defaults
```

3. Configure `ipsec` by editting the `/etc/ipsec.conf` configuration file. Here is an entire configuration template, just replace the `***.***.***.***` with your server IP.

```bash
# /etc/ipsec.conf - Openswan IPsec configuration file

# This file:  /usr/share/doc/openswan/ipsec.conf-sample
#
# Manual:     ipsec.conf.5


version 2.0 # conforms to second version of ipsec.conf specification

# basic configuration
config setup
    # Do not set debug options to debug configuration issues!
    # plutodebug / klipsdebug = "all", "none" or a combation from below:
    # "raw crypt parsing emitting control klips pfkey natt x509 dpd private"
    # eg:
    # plutodebug="control parsing"
    # Again: only enable plutodebug or klipsdebug when asked by a developer
    #
    # enable to get logs per-peer
    # plutoopts="--perpeerlog"
    #
    # Enable core dumps (might require system changes, like ulimit -C)
    # This is required for abrtd to work properly
    # Note: incorrect SElinux policies might prevent pluto writing the core
    dumpdir=/var/run/pluto/
    #
    # NAT-TRAVERSAL support, see README.NAT-Traversal
    nat_traversal=yes
    # exclude networks used on server side by adding %v4:!a.b.c.0/24
    # It seems that T-Mobile in the US and Rogers/Fido in Canada are
    # using 25/8 as "private" address space on their 3G network.
    # This range has not been announced via BGP (at least upto 2010-12-21)
    virtual_private=%v4:10.0.0.0/8,%v4:192.168.0.0/16,%v4:172.16.0.0/12,%v4:25.0.0.0/8,%v6:fd00::/8,%v6:fe80::/10
    # OE is now off by default. Uncomment and change to on, to enable.
    oe=off
    # which IPsec stack to use. auto will try netkey, then klips then mast
    protostack=auto
    # Use this to log to a file, or disable logging on embedded systems (like openwrt)
    #plutostderrlog=/dev/null


conn L2TP-PSK-noNAT
        authby=secret
        #shared secret. Use rsasig for certificates.

        pfs=no
        #Disable pfs

        auto=add
        #the ipsec tunnel should be started and routes created when the ipsec daemon itself starts.

        keyingtries=3
        #Only negotiate a conn. 3 times.

        ikelifetime=8h
        keylife=1h

        ike=aes256-sha1,aes128-sha1,3des-sha1
        phase2alg=aes256-sha1,aes128-sha1,3des-sha1
        # https://lists.openswan.org/pipermail/users/2014-April/022947.html
        # specifies the phase 1 encryption scheme, the hashing algorithm, and the diffie-hellman group. The modp1024 is for Diffie-Hellman 2. Why 'modp' instead of dh? DH2 is a 1028 bit encryption algorithm that modulo's a prime number, e.g. modp1028. See RFC 5114 for details or the wiki page on diffie hellmann, if interested.

        type=transport
        #because we use l2tp as tunnel protocol

        left=106.186.30.177
        #fill in server IP above

        leftprotoport=17/1701
        right=%any
        rightprotoport=17/%any

        dpddelay=10
        # Dead Peer Dectection (RFC 3706) keepalives delay
        dpdtimeout=20
        #  length of time (in seconds) we will idle without hearing either an R_U_THERE poll from our peer, or an R_U_THERE_ACK reply.
        dpdaction=clear
        # When a DPD enabled peer is declared dead, what action should be taken. clear means the eroute and SA with both be cleared.
```

4.  Now restart the `ipsec` service : 

```bash
âžœ ~ sudo service ipsec restart
ipsec_setup: Stopping Openswan IPsec...
ipsec_setup: Starting Openswan IPsec U2.6.38/K3.15.4-x86_64-linode45...
```

And verify the IPSEC service with :

```bash
sudo ipsec verify
```

5. Configure the `ipsec` pre-shared key, the configuration file is `/etc/ipsec.secrets`:

```bash
# This file holds shared secrets or RSA private keys for inter-Pluto
# authentication.  See ipsec_pluto(8) manpage, and HTML documentation.

# RSA private key for this host, authenticating it to any other host which knows
# the public part.  Suitable public keys, for ipsec.conf, DNS, or configuration
# of other implementations, can be extracted conveniently with "ipsec
# showhostkey".

# this file is managed with debconf and will contain the automatically created RSA keys
# include /var/lib/openswan/ipsec.secrets.inc
***.***.***.***  %any:   PSK     "some-psk-string"
```
In the configuration file, `****.***.***.***` is the server public IP and `some-psk-string` is your customized psk.

6. Configure xl2tpd, use your favorite editor to edit the `/etc/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.conf` file by repacing all the content with the following lines:

```bash
[global]
ipsec saref = yes
saref refinfo = 30

;debug avp = yes
;debug network = yes
;debug state = yes
;debug tunnel = yes

[lns default]
ip range = 172.16.1.30-172.16.1.100
local ip = 172.16.1.1
refuse pap = yes
require authentication = yes
;ppp debug = yes
pppoptfile = /etc/ppp/options.xl2tpd
length bit = yes
```

7. Configure ppp by replacing the content of `/etc/ppp/options.xl2tpd` with the following lines with your favorite editor:

```bash
require-mschap-v2
ms-dns 8.8.8.8
ms-dns 8.8.4.4
auth
mtu 1200
mru 1000
crtscts
hide-password
modem
name l2tpd
proxyarp
lcp-echo-interval 30
lcp-echo-failure 4
```

8. Add user, all the users are defied in `/etc/ppp/chap-secrets`. Here is an example configuration:

```bash
# Secrets for authentication using CHAP
# client    server  secret          IP addresses
user  *   passwd  *
```
user = username for the user.
server = the name we define in the ppp.options file for xl2tpd.
passwd = password for the user.
IP Addresses = leave to * for any address or define addresses from were a user can login.

9. All done, now start and test the service
